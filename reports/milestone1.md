# Milestones

## Summary
- Docker Compose environment set up with services for MongoDB, Qdrant, ClearML, and the app.
- Successfully ran `docker-compose up` and verified all services were running.
- Able to create all notebooks
- Unsure of what data is supposed to be used, included many urls.
- ClearML does not seem to work all of the time.
- Ollama code is provided, however errors prevent it from running.
- Would probably be able to clear up issues with more time, but the structure of the project is cohesive
